# 🌎 OnlyHuman

Tired of seeing the internet slowly turn into a soup of ChatGPT rewrites, SEO sludge and fake engagement bots?

**OnlyHuman** is a filter list for uBlock Origin (and soon compatible with other blockers) that removes obvious AI generated junk, spam bots, and synthetic content from your social feeds, search results, and websites.

## 🧹 What does it clean?

Once installed, OnlyHuman will try to hide:

- **Bot accounts** on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and more.
- **AI-generated posts**, comments, and article farms.
- **SEO garbage sites** that say nothing in 5,000 words.
- **Fake engagement** and replies clearly made by scripts.
- **Search results** that link to content farms, spinner tools, or low-effort rewrites.

If it looks like it was written by a language model in five seconds, it’s gone.  
If it talks like a bot, posts like a bot, and links like a bot... well.

## ⚙️ How to install

1. Install [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).
2. Go to “Filter lists” → “Import” and paste this URL:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FranklyRocks/OnlyHuman/refs/heads/main/list.txt
```
4. Apply Changes.
5. Breath.

## 🤖 What counts as “bot content”?

- Posts clearly generated by AI (hallucinations, filler, zero thought).
- Accounts posting 50 times a day in 12 languages about nothing.
- Websites created for SEO with no real information.
- Reply bots, bait bots, and engagement farms.

## ✅ What we don't block

- Real people, no matter how wrong they are.
- AI tools used well, subtly, or in helpful ways.
- Stuff that’s weird but obviously human.

This isn’t a censorship tool. It’s a **junk filter**.

## 📣 Want to help?

You can:

- Suggest more bot usernames or websites (via [Issues](https://github.com/FranklyRocks/onlyhuman/issues))
- Submit DOM selectors for common patterns
- Spread the word so others can clean up their feed too

## 🧪 Disclaimer

OnlyHuman is a best effort attempt to fight the flood. It won’t catch everything. It may catch too much. The web is messy, and we’re humans, not AI, so we get things wrong too.

But at least we’re trying.

Because your time is worth more than reading the 12th AI rewrite of “10 productivity tips from Stoic billionaires”.
